TODO:
- add fun web app bits like offline cache of css/js and icon and no browser bar and all that
- gradient magic on route circles
- less data usage - send timestamp of last successful request so server can send "nothing new" response instead of full json data
- figure out the weird resize on launch (ios) thing
